# WhereToMine - website data

Starting today we are sharing coin, algorithm and mining pool data we have gathered for wheretomine.io in JSON format.
Just a couple of statistics so far:
- 630 cryptocurrencies
- 126 algorithms
- 5799 mining pools

All cryptocurrencies have a small description, social media links, algorithm and a couple of more details.
 
More data about the 5799 mining pools:
- 5534 have the mining fee (95.43% availability)
- 5009 have the minimum payout threshold (86.37% availability)
- 5430 have the payment scheme (93.63% availability)

All the data was collected from BitcoinTalk announcements, mining pool websites, various wiki pages or by directly talking to coin and mining pool owners.

Data will be updated on a weekly basis.
