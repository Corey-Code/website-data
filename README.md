# WhereToMine - website data

Starting today we are sharing coin, algorithm and mining pool data we have gathered for wheretomine.io in JSON format.
Just a couple of statistics so far:
- 595 cryptocurrencies
- 124 algorithms
- 5659 mining pools

All cryptocurrencies have a small description, social media links, algorithm and a couple of more details.
 
More data about the 5659 mining pools:
- 5397 have the mining fee (95.37% availability)
- 4775 have the minimum payout threshold (84.37% availability)
- 5299 have the payment scheme (92.4% availability)

All the data was collected from BitcoinTalk announcements, mining pool websites, various wiki pages or by directly talking to coin and mining pool owners.

Data will be updated on a weekly basis.
