{"name":"Argon2d","type":"ARGON2D_ALGORITHM","slug":"argon2d","description":"Argon2d is a variant of the Argon2 cryptographic hashing algorithm. Argon2 is a key derivation function that was selected as the winner of the Password Hashing Competition in July 2015. Argon2d maximizes resistance to GPU cracking attacks. It accesses the memory array in a password dependent order, which reduces the possibility of time memory trade-off aka (TMTO) attacks, but introduces possible side-channel attacks.","defaults":{"userHashrate":0,"powerConsumption":0},"links":[{"name":"Info","platform":"info","url":"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48062/argon2i-versus-argon2d"}],"coins":[{"numberOfSubPools":4,"name":"Argentum (Argon2d)","abbreviation":"ARG","slug":"argentum-argon2d"},{"numberOfSubPools":8,"name":"Dynamic","abbreviation":"DYN","slug":"dynamic"},{"numberOfSubPools":1,"name":"Kepler (Argon2d)","abbreviation":"KPL","slug":"kepler-argon2d"},{"numberOfSubPools":6,"name":"Myriad (Argon2d)","abbreviation":"XMY","slug":"myriad-argon2d"},{"numberOfSubPools":7,"name":"Nimiq","abbreviation":"NIM","slug":"nimiq"},{"numberOfSubPools":4,"name":"Unitus (Argon2d)","abbreviation":"UIS","slug":"unitus-argon2d"},{"numberOfSubPools":11,"name":"Zumycoin","abbreviation":"ZMY","slug":"zumycoin"},{"numberOfSubPools":1,"name":"Globaltoken (Argon2d)","abbreviation":"GLT","slug":"globaltoken-argon2d"}]}
