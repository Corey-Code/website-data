{"name":"Argon2id","type":"ARGON2ID_ALGORITHM","slug":"argon2id","description":"Argon2id is a variant of the Argon2 cryptographic hashing algorithm. Argon2 is a key derivation function that was selected as the winner of the Password Hashing Competition in July 2015. Argon2d maximizes resistance to GPU cracking attacks. It accesses the memory array in a password dependent order, which reduces the possibility of time memory trade-off aka (TMTO) attacks, but introduces possible side-channel attacks.","defaults":{"userHashrate":0,"powerConsumption":0},"links":[],"coins":[{"numberOfSubPools":4,"name":"Aquachain","abbreviation":"AQUA","slug":"aquachain"}],"numberOfCoins":1}
