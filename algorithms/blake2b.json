{"name":"Blake2b","type":"BLAKE2B_ALGORITHM","slug":"blake2b","description":"BLAKE and BLAKE2 are cryptographic hash functions based on Dan Bernstein&amp;#x27;s ChaCha stream cipher, but a permuted copy of the input block, XORed with some round constants, is added before each ChaCha round. Like SHA-2, there are two variants differing in the word size. BLAKE-256 and BLAKE-224 use 32-bit words and produce digest sizes of 256 bits and 224 bits, respectively, while BLAKE-512 and BLAKE-384 use 64-bit words and produce digest sizes of 512 bits and 384 bits, respectively.","defaults":{"userHashrate":0,"powerConsumption":0},"links":[{"name":"Info","platform":"info","url":"https://blake2.net/"}],"coins":[{"numberOfSubPools":5,"name":"BitcoinX","abbreviation":"BCX","slug":"bitcoinx"},{"numberOfSubPools":2,"name":"Cash2","abbreviation":"CASH2","slug":"cash2"},{"numberOfSubPools":3,"name":"Globaltoken (Blake2b)","abbreviation":"GLT","slug":"globaltoken-blake2b"},{"numberOfSubPools":4,"name":"Hyperspace","abbreviation":"XSC","slug":"hyperspace"},{"numberOfSubPools":3,"name":"Sia Classic","abbreviation":"SCC","slug":"sia-classic"},{"numberOfSubPools":6,"name":"SiaPrime Coin","abbreviation":"SCP","slug":"siaprime-coin"},{"numberOfSubPools":4,"name":"Siacoin","abbreviation":"SC","slug":"siacoin"},{"numberOfSubPools":5,"name":"Title Network","abbreviation":"TNET","slug":"title-network"}]}
