{"name":"Cuckoo Cycle","type":"CUCKOO_CYCLE_ALGORITHM","slug":"cuckoo-cycle","description":"Cuckoo Cycle is the first graph-theoretic proof-of-work, and the most memory bound, yet with instant verification. Unlike Hashcash, Cuckoo Cycle is immune from quantum speedup by Grover&#x27;s search algorithm. Cuckatoo Cycle is a variation of Cuckoo Cycle that aims to simplify ASICs by reducing ternary counters to plain bits.","defaults":{"userHashrate":0,"powerConsumption":0},"links":[{"name":"GitHub","platform":"github","url":"https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo"}],"coins":[{"numberOfSubPools":7,"name":"Aeternity","abbreviation":"AE","slug":"aeternity"}],"numberOfCoins":1}
