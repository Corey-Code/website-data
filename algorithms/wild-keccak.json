{"name":"Wild Keccak","type":"WILD_KECCAK_ALGORITHM","slug":"wild-keccak","description":"Wild Keccak is a Keccak hybrid which uses blockchain data as scratchpad. After each Keccak round, pseudo-randomly addressed [state vector used as addresses] data is taken from scratchpad and XORed with state. Calculating each block PoW usually hits about 1100 randomly addressed reading of blocks by 32 bytes.","defaults":{"userHashrate":0,"powerConsumption":0},"links":[{"name":"Info","platform":"info","url":"http://cpucoinlist.com/cryptocurrency-algorithms/wild-keccack/"}],"coins":[{"numberOfSubPools":3,"name":"Boolberry","abbreviation":"BBR","slug":"boolberry"}],"numberOfCoins":1}
