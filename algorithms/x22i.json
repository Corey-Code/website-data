The I stands for the 22 algorithms intelligence and it is not just another clone or a copy cat of another algo but instead it has too much optimization potential for all the CUDA and OPENCL Developers because of the added complex Post Quantum algo SWIFFTX.","defaults":{"userHashrate":0,"powerConsumption":0},"links":[{"name":"BitcoinTalk","platform":"bitcointalk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5038269.0"}],"coins":[]}
