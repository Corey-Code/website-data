Monero made a huge step toward ASIC resistance, but we believe it won&#x27;t suffice for smaller oins to have a real protection against FPGA. We&#x27;re convinced people will start mining (or already started) with those.","lastUpdated":"2019-08-05T17:59:00.489Z","subPools":[{"paymentInformation":{"paymentThreshold":{"min":1,"max":314},"fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":1,"max":314},"infoUrl":"","paymentScheme":"PROP"},"isAlive":true,"lastUpdated":"2019-08-06T15:34:51.162Z","url":"https://mox.fairhash.org","slug":"5168","poolProfile":{"isVerified":false,"name":"FairHash.org","slug":"fairhash-org"}},{"paymentInformation":{"paymentThreshold":{"min":5,"max":314},"fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":0.8,"max":314},"infoUrl":"","paymentScheme":"PROP"},"isAlive":true,"lastUpdated":"2019-08-06T15:34:51.162Z","url":"https://mox.optimusblue.com","slug":"5169","poolProfile":{"isVerified":false,"name":"OptimusBlue.com","slug":"optimusblue-com"}},{"paymentInformation":{"infoUrl":"https://communitypool.org/mox","paymentThreshold":{"min":1,"max":314},"paymentScheme":"PROP","fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":0.2,"max":314},"paymentInterval":1800},"isAlive":true,"lastUpdated":"2019-08-12T11:42:20.129Z","url":"https://communitypool.org/mox","slug":"5170","poolProfile":{"isVerified":false,"name":"CommunityPool.org","slug":"communitypool-org"}},{"paymentInformation":{"infoUrl":"https://mox.miningocean.org/","paymentThreshold":{"min":5,"max":314},"paymentScheme":"PROP","fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":0.4,"max":314},"paymentInterval":600},"isAlive":true,"lastUpdated":"2019-08-12T14:01:40.185Z","url":"https://mox.miningocean.org","slug":"5167","poolProfile":{"isVerified":false,"name":"MiningOcean.org","slug":"miningocean-org"}}],"numberOfSubPools":4,"links":[{"name":"Website","platform":"website","url":"https://getmox.org/"},{"name":"Explorer","platform":"explorer","url":"https://blockexplorer.getmox.org/"},{"name":"Twitter","platform":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Project_MoX"},{"name":"Discord","platform":"discord","url":"https://discord.gg/tkcPZVF"},{"name":"Telegram","platform":"telegram","url":"https://t.me/MoXproject"},{"name":"BitcionTalk","platform":"bitciontalk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4724483.0"},{"name":"GitHub","platform":"github","url":"https://github.com/mox-project"}],"algorithm":{"name":"CryptoNight Red","type":"CRYPTONIGHT_RED_ALGORITHM","slug":"cryptonight-red"},"coinCap":{"isAvailable":false,"id":"noid"}}
