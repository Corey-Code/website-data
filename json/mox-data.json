{"id":"mox","description":"Hardware Specialization Resistance We want to make MoX the most resistant to specialized hardware mining (FPGA/ASICs) in the CryptoNote ecosystem. Monero made a huge step toward ASIC resistance, but we believe it won't suffice for smaller oins to have a real protection against FPGA. We're convinced people will start mining (or already started) with those.","links":[{"type":"Website","url":"https://getmox.org/"},{"type":"Explorer","url":"https://blockexplorer.getmox.org/"},{"type":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Project_MoX"},{"type":"Discord","url":"https://discord.gg/tkcPZVF"},{"type":"Telegram","url":"https://t.me/MoXproject"},{"type":"BitcionTalk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4724483.0"},{"type":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/mox-project"}],"name":"MoX","abbreviation":"MOX","algorithm":{"id":"cryptonight-red","name":"CryptoNight Red"},"pools":[{"name":"MiningOcean.org","url":"https://mox.miningocean.org","serverLocation":["NL"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentThreshold":5,"fee":0.4}},{"name":"FairHash.org","url":"https://mox.fairhash.org","serverLocation":["DE"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentThreshold":1,"fee":1}},{"name":"OptimusBlue.com","url":"https://mox.optimusblue.com","serverLocation":["US"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentThreshold":5,"fee":0.8}},{"name":"CommunityPool.org","url":"https://communitypool.org/mox","serverLocation":["CA"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentThreshold":1,"fee":0.2}}],"wallets":[]}
