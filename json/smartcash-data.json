{"id":"smartcash","description":"SmartCash is a community governance, cooperation & growth focused blockchain based currency & a decentralized economy. SmartCash mining prevents mining centralization and stimulate network growth. Every computer can be used as a mining device while still allowing that computer to be used for various other tasks. ASICs have yet to be created for the Keccak mining algorithm and itâ€™s probably safe to assume no ASICs will be created for quite some time, until Smartcash reaches a considerable market cap.","links":[{"type":"Website","url":"https://smartcash.cc/"},{"type":"Explorer","url":"http://explorer.smartcash.cc/"},{"type":"Explorer","url":"https://insight.smartcash.cc/"},{"type":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/1425526204234361"},{"type":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/scashofficial"},{"type":"Reddit","url":"https://reddit.com/r/smartcash"},{"type":"Telegram","url":"https://t.me/SmartCashChat"},{"type":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/SmartCash"}],"name":"SmartCash","abbreviation":"SMART","algorithm":{"id":"keccak","name":"Keccak"},"pools":[{"name":"SmartCash.cc","url":"https://us-mine.smartcash.cc","serverLocation":["US"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"","paymentThreshold":0.1,"fee":0}},{"name":"SmartCash.cc","url":"https://eu-mine.smartcash.cc","serverLocation":["EU"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"","paymentThreshold":0.01,"fee":0}},{"name":"SmartCash.cc","url":"https://asia-mine.smartcash.cc","serverLocation":["HK"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"","paymentThreshold":0.01,"fee":0}},{"name":"Mining-Dutch.nl","url":"https://www.mining-dutch.nl/pools/smartcash.php","serverLocation":["FR"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentThreshold":314,"fee":2}},{"name":"NLPool","url":"https://www.nlpool.nl","serverLocation":["US"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentThreshold":0.001,"paymentCurrency":"BTC","fee":0.25}},{"name":"ZergPool","url":"http://zergpool.com","serverLocation":["US"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentThreshold":0.0001,"paymentCurrency":"BTC","fee":0.5}}],"wallets":[]}
