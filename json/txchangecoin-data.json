{"id":"txchangecoin","description":"Txchangecoin (TXX) is an open-source cryptocurrency that focuses on fungibility, privacy and decentralization. Txchangecoin uses an obfuscated public ledger, this simply means that anybody can broadcast or send transactions, but no outside observer can tell the source, amount or destination. It uses a Proof of Work mechanism to issue new coins and incentivize miners to secure the network and validate transactions.","links":[{"name":"Website","platform":"website","url":"https://txchange.online/"},{"name":"Explorer","platform":"explorer","url":"https://explorer.txchange.online/"},{"name":"Twitter","platform":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/txchangecoin"},{"name":"Discord","platform":"discord","url":"https://discord.gg/ugP3EZM"},{"name":"Telegram","platform":"telegram","url":"https://t.me/txchangecoin"},{"name":"BitcoinTalk","platform":"bitcointalk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5139379.0"},{"name":"GitHub","platform":"github","url":"https://github.com/txchangecoin-project/txchangecoin"}],"name":"Txchangecoin","abbreviation":"TXX","algorithm":{"id":"cryptonight-r","name":"CryptoNight R"},"pools":[{"name":"TxChange.online","url":"https://pools.txchange.online","serverLocation":["IT"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentThreshold":{"min":1,"max":314},"fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":2,"max":314},"infoUrl":"","paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentInterval":1800}},{"name":"Pool-Pay.com","url":"http://txx.pool-pay.com","serverLocation":["DE"],"paymentInformation":{"paymentThreshold":{"min":1,"max":314},"fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":314,"max":314},"infoUrl":"","paymentScheme":"PROP","paymentInterval":60}}]}
